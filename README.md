# TeleBot

I was creating an AI Intelligent telegram bot using Python. For this I used Tensorflow, nltk, opencv and some of the others libraries.
But I found some problem, that I can't fix anyway.. The program throws and error, given below- 

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "c:\Users\**user_name**\Documents\Programes\Python\TeleBot_2\main.py", line 1, in <module>
    import cv2
  File "C:\Users\**user_name**\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\lib\site-packages\cv2\__init__.py", line 8, in <module>
    from .cv2 import *
ImportError: DLL load failed while importing cv2: The specified module could not be found.
  
  
Someone, can help me to get out from here?
  I'm stuck in this postion
  Even I don't get the problem!!
